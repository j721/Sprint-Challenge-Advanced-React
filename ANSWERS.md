- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

There are a lot of hidden processes behind using the hooks in the function components that could be a little confusing to know whatâ€™s going on (i.e. the react lifecycle) compared to using the class component where the order in which the lifecycle is executed is apparent. 



- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    Mounting phase- the first load, first time a component comes into use with an application. Bringing components into being 	as needed to MOUNT

	Updating phase-where we handle state change. Where we are updating the component data

	UnMounting phase- Removing the component from the screen

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    A custom hook allows us to keep our code our DRY by being able to create code that uses logic, most often inside of a function. This also helps for a code to be cleaner and easier to read, since we able to reuse that custom hook again and again throughout our code. 


- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    To make sure that our application is working and to find if there are any bugs or problems within our app. Allows us to	trust the code and makes us think about edge cases that can come from users experiencing the application.
